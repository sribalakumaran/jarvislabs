# Day 1 as Software Intern at JarvisLabs.ai

Today, I embarked on an exciting new journey as I joined the team at [JarvisLabs.ai](https://www.jarvislabs.ai/) as an intern. From the moment I stepped in, I knew this experience was going to be something special.

# JarvisLabs Products

First, I explored how the products work from a user's perspective. I examined the differences between using ComfyUI with and without JarvisLabs' products. Additionally, I looked into how others can access the product, the steps involved for users to use the product, and how instances are managed when they are created, paused, or deleted, along with the associated costs.

**Using ComfyUI Without JarvisLabs Products:**

-   **Setup:** Users need to manually set up and configure the environment which is very difficult.
-   **Performance:** Performance depends on the user's local hardware capabilities.
-   **Scalability:** Limited by local hardware; scaling up requires additional hardware investments.

**Using ComfyUI With JarvisLabs Products:**

-   **Setup:** Simplified setup with pre-configured environments.
-   **Performance:** Enhanced performance using JarvisLabs' powerful cloud infrastructure.
-   **Scalability:** Easy to scale up or down based on needs without additional hardware investment.

# Comfy UI

My first day was exploring ComfyUI, a powerful and user-friendly interface designed to streamline interactions with AI models.
  -	   **Intuitive Layout:** ComfyUI is built with the user in mind. Its intuitive layout and easy-to-navigate features make it accessible even for those who are new to AI.
-   **Quick Onboarding:** I was able to quickly get up to speed and start experimenting with its capabilities without much hassle.
-   **Customization:** It offers a range of powerful tools that allow for deep customization and fine-tuning of AI models.
-   **Integration:** The interface effortlessly integrates with various AI frameworks, making it a versatile tool for any AI enthusiast or professional.

## Things that I learnt in Comfy UI
-  **How to run the models:** I learnt to use various models like checkpoints, loRA and how to import new models into comfy.ui.
-  **How to utilize the Control Nets:** Control nets are nodes that specialize in taking prompts and reference images, allowing us to control the generated image.

## Looking Ahead

As I reflect on my first day, I am filled with a sense of anticipation and excitement for what’s to come. I’m eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing to the innovative projects at JarvisLabs.ai. The future holds immense possibilities, and I’m thrilled to be part of a team that is at the forefront of AI advancement.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey at JarvisLabs.ai.
